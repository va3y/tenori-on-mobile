        Tenori-on is an instrument created by Toshio Iwai in 2007. It consists
        of a hand-held screen comprised from sixteen-by-sixteen grid of LED
        switches. Any of these switches may be activated in a number of
        different ways to create sounds.

        Here's what the creator has to say:

        <div class="quote">
          In days gone by, a musical instrument had to have a beauty, of shape
          as well as of sound, and had to fit the player almost organically.
          Modern electronic instruments don't have this inevitable relationship
          between the shape, the sound, and the player.
          <br />
          <br />What I have done is to try to bring back these elements and
          build them in to a true musical instrument for the digital age.
